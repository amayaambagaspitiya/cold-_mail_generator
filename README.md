# Cold Email Generator
This project aims to streamline the process of generating cold emails by extracting relevant information from career pages and transforming it into a structured format. The system uses Llama 3.1 and GROQ to generate fast responses in the cloud.

Features
Extract Information from Career Pages: The system scrapes career pages to pull out key information about the company, job openings, and other relevant details.
Transform Data into JSON Format: The scraped data is converted into a structured JSON format using LLM (Large Language Model).
Cold Email Generation: Using Llama 3.1, the system generates cold emails based on the extracted and formatted information.
Fast Response Using GROQ: Instead of running Llama 3.1 locally, which could be slow, the system utilizes GROQ to run the model in the cloud for faster processing and response times.
